# PlayPix

A playful way to explore pixel art through platforming.
This project uses react-color for the color picker in the tile designer
and the character designer. Find it here: https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/

PlayPix serves as both a level editor and a pixel art creator. People are free to create or play others' levels, guiding a playable character to the finish, or make pieces of pixel art for others to marvel at.
